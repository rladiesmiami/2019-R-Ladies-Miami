# tidymodels

The `tidymodels` packages are a collection that are used for different types of modeling and are consistent with the design principles of the tidyverse. 

They are fairly young (compared to `caret`) but are finally at a point where we have most of the basics covered. 

I'll (very) briefly introduce some of these packages before we get to the new one. 


```r
library(tidymodels) # This presentation uses devtools::install_dev("tune")

# Demonstration data

These data are used in our [Feature Engineering and Selection](https://bookdown.org/max/FES/chicago-intro.html) book. 

Several years worth of data were assembled to try to predict the daily number of people entering the Clark and Lake elevated ("L") train station in Chicago. 

For predictors, 

* the 14-day lagged ridership at this and other stations (units: thousands of rides/day)

* weather data

* home/away game schedules for Chicago teams

* the date

The data are in `modeldata`. See `?Chicago`.

# Pre-processing the data

In these data, the ridership from other stations are important predictors but they are highly correlated. 

This might be bad for some models so we should probably reduce the correlation by eliminating columns or re-encoding the variables as _principal components_. 

Also, the date is a strong predictor. We can engineer this into day/month/year indicators as well as indicators for holidays. 

We'll create a recipe to do this.

# Creating Models with {parsnip}

.pull-left[
Like a recipe, we create a _model specification_ of what we want to do:


```r
knn_mod &lt;- nearest_neighbor(neighbors = 5) %&gt;% 
  # The "engine" is the method for 
  # estimating parameters. For KNN
  set_engine("kknn") %&gt;% 
  # The mode is the type of model (we have a
  # numeric outcome)
  set_mode("regression")
```

_Then_ we give it the data to fit the model:


```r
# Just an example with the raw data

fitted &lt;- 
  knn_mod %&gt;% 
  fit(ridership ~ Monroe + humidity, data = Chicago)
```

]
.pull-right[
The important piece is that, unlike traditional modeling functions (like `lm()`), we separate:

 * what we want to do ("fit this type of model")
 
from 
 
 * doing it ("estimate stuff with these data")

This allows us to use arguments that can't be evaluated at that time. 

]

---

# Define the Data Analysis Process

.pull-left[
Let's conceptualize a process or _workflow_ that involves all of the steps where the data are analyzed in a significant way. The includes the model but might also include other _estimation_ steps:

 * data preparation steps (e.g. imputation, encoding, transformations, etc)
 
 * selection of which terms go into the model

and so on. 

Admittedly, there is some grey area here.

# Tuning Parameters

These are model parameters that cannot be _directly_ estimated from the data.

Examples:

 * number of nearest neighbors
 
 * depth of a classification tree
 
 * amount of regularization
 
 * covariance structure
 
 * distance weighting function

Often, reasonable values for these are found using a search procedure coupled with resampling methods. 

How can we tell the model function that we don't know their values? 

---

# K-NN Tuning parameters

The `dist_power` parameter is related to the type of distance calculation. `dist_power = 2` is everyday Euclidean distance, `dist_power = 1` is Manhattan distance, and so on. Fractional values are acceptable. 

`weight_func` determines how much influence neighbors have based on their distance:

# Tagging Tunable Parameters

In `parsnip` models (and `recipes`), parameters that need tuning are marked using the `tune()` function in the `{tune}` package. 

`tune()` just returns an expression

.pull-left[

```r
str(tune())
```

```
##  language tune()
```

```r
# Let's optimize two parameters:
knn_mod &lt;- 
  nearest_neighbor(
*   neighbors = tune(),
*   weight_func = tune()
  ) %&gt;% 
  set_engine("kknn") %&gt;% 
  set_mode("regression")
```
]
.pull-right[

```r
chi_rec &lt;-
  recipe(ridership ~ ., data = Chicago) %&gt;%
  step_holiday(date) %&gt;%
  step_date(date) %&gt;%
  step_rm(date) %&gt;%
  step_dummy(all_nominal()) %&gt;%
  step_zv(all_predictors()) %&gt;%
  step_normalize(one_of(!!stations)) %&gt;% 
* step_pca(one_of(!!stations), num_comp = tune()) %&gt;%
  step_normalize(all_predictors())

# Elements required for grid search

.pull-left[
* The model and pre-processor.

* Measure of model performance.  

* A resampling scheme to reliably estimate model performance

* A set of candidate models to compare (aka the "grid" in grid search)

There are two main types of grids: regular and non-regular. 

We default to using a special kind of non-regular grid called a space-filling statistical design. You can use any type of grid that you want though.

# Resampling with {rsample}

Resampling methods, like 10-fold cross-validation or the bootstrap, are methods that can be used to get good estiamtes of how well our models are performing. 

Our resampling scheme will emulate this using [rolling forecasting origin](https://otexts.com/fpp2/accuracy.html) resampling with

* Moving analysis sets of 15 years moving over 28 day periods
* An assessment set of the most recent 28 days of data

.font80[


```r
time_resamples &lt;- rolling_origin(Chicago, initial = 364 * 15, assess = 7 * 2, skip = 7 * 2, cumulative = FALSE)
time_resamples
```

```
## # Rolling origin forecast resampling 
## # A tibble: 15 x 2
##    splits            id     
##    &lt;list&gt;            &lt;chr&gt;

# Optimizing Parameters

The functions `tune_grid()` or `tune_bayes()` can detect these and optimize then using grid search or Bayesian optimization, respectively:


```r
# Test 20 values using a space-filling design
set.seed(2132)
grid_results &lt;- knn_mod %&gt;% tune_grid(chi_rec, resamples = time_resamples, grid = 20)
```

What you get back is a tibble with the results

```r
grid_results %&gt;% slice(1:5)

# Some notes

* The `grid` option can be an integer or a data frame of specific settings. Also, different metrics can be passed in. 

* These models can be run in parallel using the `foreach` package (the same as `caret`)

* You can easily change the default parameter ranges (e.g. PCA components &gt; 4)

* The models and predictions are not automatically saved but there are options to get those. 

* We capture errors and warnings as they happen and tell you which model they are from (***do the demo!***). 

* There are functions to take these results and use them to finalize the original recipe and model objects.  

* The recipe is remade for every resample; the estimated from the training data are applied to all data.

# Sequential search

Instead of using a pre-defined set of tuning parameters, there are techniques for finding new values based on the existing results. 

_Bayesian optimization_ is popular and we have a function to do that: 


```r
set.seed(22)
search_results &lt;- knn_mod %&gt;% tune_bayes(chi_rec, resamples = time_resamples)
```

See the [package vignettes](https://tidymodels.github.io/tune/) for examples and explanations.
